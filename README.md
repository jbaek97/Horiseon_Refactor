# Horiseon_Refactor

## Description
This project was made in order to refactor the HTML and CSS of a webpage for a marketing agency called "Horiseon". The main goal for the refactoring was to help the webpage follow accessibility standards and to be opitimzied for the search engines. In terms of the HTML, the code was refactored so that "div" tags were semantic in order to make the code easier to read and in a better organzied fashion. On the CSS side, certain CSS rules had overlapping functions which caused the style page to be unneccessarily long and complicated. This was countered by consolidating those rules into composites of those rules. After these composites were made, I organized the rules so they can reflect the structure of the HTML. However, in order to ensure the maximum amount of clarity, I also commented on the CSS creating headers that indicate which CSS rules are affecting which section in HTML. Through this progress I learned about how much of an effect organization can have on the aesthetic and understanding of a website. I also learned about how important it is to plan accordingly before coding in order to lower the probability of having to refactor.
